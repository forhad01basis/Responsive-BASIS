    <p>At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being
      in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a
      weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace
      of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to
      chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.<br />
      <br />
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control
      System - a system that allows you full control.
      Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality,

      <br />
      It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of
      security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced.
      From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID

  <h3>How the Ceasefire Access Control System works.</h3>
  <div align="center"><img src="images/img_3.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="664" /></div>
  <div id="content_wrapper" style="float:left;">
    <p>An access control point can be a door, turnstile, parking
      gate, elevator, or other physical barrier where granting
      access can be electronically controlled.<br />
      <br />
      Access control can contain several elements. At its most
      basic, is a standalone electric lock, which is unlocked by an
      operator with a switch. To automate this, operator
      intervention is replaced by a reader. Readers could be a
      keypad where a code is entered, a card reader, or a
      biometric reader. Readers then send the card number to
      an access control panel that verifies the number against an
      access list.<br />
      <br />
      To monitor the door position, magnetic door switches are
      used. Generally only entry is controlled. In cases where the
      exit is also controlled, a second reader is installed on the
      other side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled,
      a device called request-to- exit (RTE) is used.<br />
      Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion
      detector. When the button is pushed or the motion detector
      detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily
      ignored while the door is opened.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="content_wrapper" style="float:right;">
    <p>All access door hardware is connected directly
      to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do
      not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the
      main controller.<br />
      <br />
      Only in the event that the connection to the main controller is
      unavailable, themain controller.<br />
      <br />
      atabase to make access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent readers
      that have no database and cannot function without the main
      controller should be used only in areas that do not require
      high security. Main controllers usually support 16 to 64
      readers.<br />
      <br />
      The Ceasefire Access Control System also makes for the
      perfect attendance record-keeper.readers.
      ognition, access card entry and supreme SFM fingerprint
      modules designed to provide biometric security, the
      Ceasefire Access Control System gives a powerful
      verification performance that wipes out the possibility for any
      proxy attendances. Also, with its easy integration with various
      other external databases, other functions like work-hour
      calculation and salary calculation become an easy task.</p>
