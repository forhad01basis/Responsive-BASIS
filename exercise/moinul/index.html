            <h2>Introducing the country’s most advanced Access Control System.</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="div-2"><p>Employees, staff, clients, deliverymen, couriers... these days, it’s hard to keep track of people on your premises. Security guards do their best to check records and credentials, but there’s always a chance of a security breach. With so many people coming and going, restricted areas can be easily accessed, important documents and material copied and goods and expensive equipment can be stolen. What’s more, guards and people can even be bribed to let an unauthorised person enter.
To make matters worse, shift duties add to the confusion. And valuable man-hours are spent on registers, records and overall attendance.
The need of the hour is a system that grants access to only authorised personnel. A system that’s intelligent enough to differentiate one employee from the other, add layers of access control and even track and monitor attendance.
Ceasefire brings you just a system – the Ceasefire Access Control System, the most advanced in the country.</p></div>

        <div><h1>Why Ceasefire Access Control</h1>
            <p>At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.
Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control System - a system that allows you full control.
Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality, design and performance, in some of the world’s leading manufacturing facilities, this top-of-the-line range is a system like no other.
It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced. From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID restricted areas, the Access Control System guarantees complete protection. In other words, it chooses who can gain access and who can’t, while performing all the duties of a time-keeper, attendance monitor and salary manager. It records, tracks and reports 24x7.</p>
