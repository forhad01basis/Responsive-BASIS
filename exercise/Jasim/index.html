                        Employees, staff, clients, deliverymen, couriers… these
                        days, it’s hard to keep track of people on your premises.
                        Security guards do their best to check records and
                        credentials, but there’s always a chance of a security
                        breach. With so many people coming and going, restricted
                        areas can be easily accessed, important documents and
                        material copied and goods and expensive equipment can be
                        stolen. What’s more, guards and people can even be bribed
                        to let an unauthorised person enter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make matters worse, shift duties add to the confusion.
                        And valuable man-hours are spent on registers, records and
                        overall attendance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The need of the hour is a system that grants access to only
                        authorised personnel. A system that’s intelligent enough to
                        differentiate one employee from the other, add layers of
                        access control and even track and monitor attendance. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ceasefire brings you just a system – the Ceasefire Access
                        Control System, the most advanced in the country.

                <div class="fixed mobileText floatRight">
                    <p>At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being
                        in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a
                        weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace
                        of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to
                        chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.</p>

                    <p>
                        Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control
                        System - a system that allows you full control.
                        Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality,
                        design and performance, in some of the world’s leading
                        manufacturing facilities, this top-of-the-line range is a system
                        like no other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of
                        security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced.
                        From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID
                        restricted areas, the Access Control System guarantees
                        complete protection. In other words, it chooses who can
                        gain access and who can’t, while performing all the duties of
                        a time-keeper, attendance monitor and salary manager. It
                        records, tracks and reports 24x7.

                <h2 class="redhedding" >How the Ceasefire Access Control System works.</h2>
                <div class="fixed fullDig">
                    <img src="img/fullDig.PNG" alt="image not found"/>
                </div>

                <div class="fixed fullText floatLeft">
                    <p>An access control point can be a door, turnstile, parking 
                        gate, elevator, or other physical barrier where granting 
                        access can be electronically controlled.</p>

                    <p>
                        Access control can contain several elements. At its most
                        basic, is a standalone electric lock, which is unlocked by an
                        operator with a switch. To automate this, operator
                        intervention is replaced by a reader. Readers could be a
                        keypad where a code is entered, a card reader, or a
                        biometric reader. Readers then send the card number to
                        an access control panel that verifies the number against an
                        access list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To monitor the door position, magnetic door switches are
                        used. Generally only entry is controlled. In cases where the
                        exit is also controlled, a second reader is installed on the
                        other side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled,
                        a device called request-to- exit (RTE) is used.
                        Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion
                        detector. When the button is pushed or the motion detector
                        detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily
                        ignored while the door is opened.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="fixed fullText floatRight">
                    <p>All access door hardware is connected directly
                        to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do 
                        not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the 
                        main controller.</p>

                    <p>
                        Only in the event that the connection to the main controller is
                        unavailable, the readers use their internal database to make
                        access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent readers
                        that have no database and cannot function without the main
                        controller should be used only in areas that do not require
                        high security. Main controllers usually support 16 to 64 
                        readers.

                        The Ceasefire Access Control System also makes for the
                        perfect attendance record-keeper. Loaded with face
                        recognition, access card entry and supreme SFM fingerprint
                        modules designed to provide biometric security, the
                        Ceasefire Access Control System gives a powerful
                        verification performance that wipes out the possibility for any
                        proxy attendances. Also, with its easy integration with various 
                        other external databases, other functions like work-hour 
                        calculation and salary calculation become an easy task.
